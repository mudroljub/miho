      <p>The Story about bullo is set in 1930’s, In an imaginary world of humanoid animals.</p>

      <p>Bullo is a criminal, a contract killer, a dangerous and an unpredictable person with a few rules about the job: no children, no women and no funny guys. Bullo lives in new york and his best friend is bernie, a humanoid with a domestic cat head. Since bullo is a humanoid with a bull terrier head, bernie was the best choice for the second main character. To have ’a dog and a cat’ as main characters is the perfect combo. They argue a lot, mainly because of bullo’s health issues, which are related to the hemorrhoids at the moment.</p>

      <p>The first story is named ’’HAVANA’’, and it is about a business deal that takes them to cuba, a promise land for those who admire cuban cigars and gambling.</p>

      <p>Aside of bullo and bernie, there are also many other characters who are mostly criminals, with a few exceptions.</p>

      <p>As the story goes further, bullo and bernie get in a conflitc with DADDY PIG, a humanoid with pig’s head-a gangster and a casino owner. Soon after they manage to get to cuba, they meet THREE LITTLE PIGS, dangerous brothers and daddy pig’s nephews...</p>

      <p>Since this graphic novel is planned to be NFT minted and for now only displayed here and on other links related to the bullo story, i would like you to follow bullo’s journey and discover what happened in the end.</p>

      <p>The graphic novel is made with pencil, ink and watercolour on a 300 grams fabriano paper, size a4.</p>

      <p>Bullo is made by MIHO, a sculptor by profession with huge love for comics.</p>
